This framework allows you to rapidly create Models for your project.  Using SQL Server, it automatically creates tables and saves the data in an Object Oriented fashion.

This means you can create and use OOP without worrying about the incompatibilities of a relational database!

When used in ASP.NET applications, it contains many useful features, such as automatically creating user-input forms based on your model.

Provided as a Visual Studio 2005 solution.
